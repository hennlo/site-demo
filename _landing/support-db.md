Polypheny supports two types of underlying databases, **Sources** and **Stores**.

**Sources** are managed externally and can directly be attached to Polypheny to retrieve all contaioned data through all query interfaces.

Additionally Polypheny supports **Stores** to fully manage and retrieve all integrated data through Polypheny to take full control of all operations.
Such as defining the schema, managing their content, as well as partitioning and replicating to distribute the data globally.
