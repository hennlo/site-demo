Polypheny is a multi-model PolyDBMS. The PolyDBMS concept is an evolution from the polystore concept. A polyDBMS combines multiple database into a unified systems, which allows database administrators to interact with one unified system but still query all underlying systems. 

It allows to not only query the unterlying systems but also do define schemas as well as modify the data of those systems.

This allows to work with a wide range of heterogenous data of various kind and type.
