Polypheny is a multi-model PolyDBMS. The PolyDBMS concept is an evolution from the polystore concept. A PolyDBMS combines multiple databases into a unified system, which allows database administrators and engineers to interact with one unified system but still query all underlying systems. 

It allows to not only query the underlying systems but also do define schemas as well as modify the data of those systems.

This enables you to work with a wide range of heterogenous data of various kind and type.
